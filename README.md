## 📝 Description

**Atomic Bomber** is a classic 2D **arcade-style bombing game** developed as a project for the *Advanced Programming* course at Sharif University of Technology.

In this game, the player pilots a bomber aircraft that continuously flies over a city landscape. The goal is to **drop bombs** and **destroy all buildings** before the plane crashes into them as it flies lower with each pass.

This project focuses on **JavaFX** for graphical user interface design and game animation, and features **object-oriented programming**, **event handling**, and **data persistence** using **JSON files**.
